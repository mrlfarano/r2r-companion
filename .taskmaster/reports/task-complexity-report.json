		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down each infrastructure and setup step into atomic actions, such as initializing the repository, configuring each tool (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript), setting up CI/CD for both frontend and backend, and documenting each process. Include subtasks for environment variable management, deployment verification, and onboarding documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (frontend, backend, CI/CD, deployment platforms), cross-cutting concerns (linting, formatting, type safety), and requires coordination between environments. Each configuration step can fail independently and needs verification, making the overall setup moderately high in complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create MongoDB Database Schema and Connection",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for cluster setup, schema design for each entity, environment variable management, connection logic, seed data creation, error handling, indexing, and backup strategy documentation.",
			"reasoning": "While database setup is a standard backend task, it involves several distinct steps (infrastructure, schema, connection, data seeding, error handling, indexing, backup) that each require careful attention but are not deeply interdependent or algorithmically complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop REST API Endpoints for Items and Builds",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for each endpoint (CRUD for items and builds), middleware implementation (validation, error handling, rate limiting), advanced query features (search, filter, sort, pagination), API documentation, security, and caching.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers a broad API surface, requires robust validation and error handling, and includes advanced features like search, filtering, and security. Each endpoint and middleware can be developed and tested independently, but the overall integration and correctness raise the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Item Database and Image Assets",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for data research, image sourcing and optimization, JSON structuring, import script development, data validation, and metadata enrichment.",
			"reasoning": "This is a data-heavy task with moderate technical complexity. The main challenges are data accuracy, consistency, and image optimization, but the steps are well-defined and mostly sequential."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Frontend Item Display Component",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for each UI component (list, card, detail, search, filter), state management, responsive design, accessibility, animations, and error/loading states.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires building multiple interactive and visually rich components, integrating search/filter logic, and ensuring responsive, accessible design. The need for smooth UX and state management increases the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Character Selection and Build Recommendation UI",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for character selection UI, build recommendation display, synergy visualization, filtering, responsive design, state management, and accessibility testing.",
			"reasoning": "While the UI is feature-rich and interactive, the complexity is moderate due to the clear separation of concerns and the mostly presentational nature of the components. State management and synergy visualization add some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Build Recommendation Logic",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for data structure design, core algorithm implementation, weighting/prioritization system, explanation generation, performance optimization, edge case handling, and integration with frontend/backend.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most algorithmically complex task, involving custom logic, data modeling, scoring systems, and explanation generation. It requires careful design, testing, and optimization to ensure accuracy and performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Mobile-First Responsive Design",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for responsive layout implementation, mobile navigation, touch interaction optimization, performance testing, offline/PWA features, and accessibility.",
			"reasoning": "Ensuring a seamless mobile experience involves multiple layers (layout, navigation, performance, offline support), but each can be addressed with established patterns and frameworks, keeping complexity moderate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Add User Authentication and Saved Builds",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for authentication backend, user profile modeling, frontend UI flows, saved builds CRUD, security hardening, social login integration, account management, and compliance features.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication and user data management are inherently complex due to security, data integrity, and UX requirements. Multiple flows (registration, login, password reset, saved builds) and security best practices must be implemented and tested."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Prepare Visual Search Integration Framework",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for CV model research, image capture UI, preprocessing pipeline, TensorFlow.js integration, API scaffolding, feature flag system, and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Laying the groundwork for visual search involves research, frontend and backend scaffolding, and integration planning. While the actual CV implementation is deferred, the setup requires cross-disciplinary coordination and future-proofing."
