# Contributing Guide

## Branching Strategy

- Use `main` for production-ready code
- Create feature branches: `feature/<short-description>`
- Use `fix/` or `chore/` prefixes for bugfixes and maintenance

## Pull Requests

- Open PRs against `main`
- Write clear PR titles and descriptions
- Reference related issues
- Ensure all checks pass before requesting review

## Code Style

- Use Prettier and ESLint
- Write clear, concise commit messages
